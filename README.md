# AP Exam Score Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts student performance on AP exams using various classification algorithms.

## Overview
This project implemented multiple ML models to predict whether students will pass or fail AP exams based on historical performance data and demographic factors.

## Models Implemented
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
