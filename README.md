# AP Exam Score Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts student performance on AP exams using various classification algorithms.

## Overview
This project implemented multiple ML models to predict whether students will pass or fail AP exams based on historical performance data and demographic factors.

## Models Implemented
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## Results
[heatmap] (heatmap.png)
- Best performing model: KNN model with 59.11% accuracy

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run individual models: `python models/[model_name].py`
